# Mixcloud Tracklist browser extension

This is an *unofficial* Mixcloud browser extension. It displays the tracklist
the same way it did before they changed their [licensing][mc-support].

> As a non-interactive streaming service, our licenses don't allow for
> tracklists to be made visible in advance. However as you listen through a
> show or DJ mix set, the track names will be revealed.

The extension has been built with [Mozilla's WebExtensions API][moz-webext] so
it should be compatible with Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and any other
browser that supports the WebExtension APIs.

## Install
