# Mixcloud Tracklist browser extension

This is an *unofficial* Chrome and Firefox extension for Mixcloud. It displays
the tracklist the same way it did before they changed their licensing. For many
of us, the tracklist was one of the best features of Mixcloud, and I feel lost
without it.

## Install
 - [Chrome extensions web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mixcloud-tracklist/lkoingeajallinlnijfpmmddoeoficef)
 - [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mixcloud-tracklist/)

See http://support.mixcloud.com/customer/portal/articles/1595557 for the
official reason behind the recent change.
> As a non-interactive streaming service, our licenses don't allow for
> tracklists to be made visible in advance. However as you listen through a
> show or DJ mix set, the track names will be revealed.

Thanks to [Perry Harlock](https://github.com/perryharlock) for helping me figure
out the HTML template structure.

## Help Wanted!
This extension currently supports Google Chrome (tested on 44.0.2403.125
(64-bit)) and Firefox (tested on 39.0 (64-bit)) but should be able to support
other browsers with a bit of work.
