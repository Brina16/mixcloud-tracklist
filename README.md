# Mixcloud Tracklist browser extension

This is an *Unofficial* browser extension for Mixcloud. It displays the
tracklist the same way it did before they changed their licensing.

See http://support.mixcloud.com/customer/portal/articles/1595557 for the
official reason behind the recent change.
> As a non-interactive streaming service, our licenses don't allow for
> tracklists to be made visible in advance. However as you listen through a
> show or DJ mix set, the track names will be revealed.
